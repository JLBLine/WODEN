# Summary
Observational astronomy at low radio-wavelengths (~50 to 500$\,$MHz) is often undertaken by a type of telescope called an interferometer. These instruments combine signals from hundreds of receivers (often simple dipole antennas)

# Statement of need
We need it to feed into [@Mitchell2008].

That citation didn't work, does the example one work? [@Tingay2013]
