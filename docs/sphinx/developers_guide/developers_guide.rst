DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md
===================

.. note::

   I'm just linking the top-level ``DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md`` (which can be read online on github) here, so it can live on ReadTheDocs as well. As paths to images are hard coded in the markdown, I've added softlinks inside ``docs/sphinx/developers_guide`` (where the images live) to ``docs/sphinx/developers_guide/docs/sphinx/developers_guide`` so we can use the same images in the markdown as in the sphinx documentation. Bit clunky but hey it works.

.. include:: ../../../DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md
   :parser: myst_parser.sphinx_
