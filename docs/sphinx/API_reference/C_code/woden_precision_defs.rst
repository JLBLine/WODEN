``woden_precision_defs``
=========================

A header to set the precision required internally to ``WODEN``.

.. note:: I haven't worked out how to get doxygen/sphinx to show the whole defintion here, which includes an `#ifdef`, so only shows the definition for float below.

.. doxygenfile:: woden_precision_defs.h
   :project: WODEN
