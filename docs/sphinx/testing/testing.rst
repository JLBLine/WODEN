Testing
----------

There are two ways to test WODEN. The first is to use the CMake testing suite which is more for developing ``WODEN``, and contains unit/integration tests for ``Python``, ``C``, and ``GPU`` code. The second is via the ``test_installation`` directory which contains a number of commands that can be used to test the functionality of the local installation of ``WODEN``. See below for details.

As a temporary measure while developing`everybeam` functionality , I've made a number of notebooks that live in `WODEN/test_installation/everybeam/`. Click below to see what they do.
