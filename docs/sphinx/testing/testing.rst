Testing
----------

There are two ways to test WODEN. The first is to use the CMake testing suite which is more for developing ``WODEN``, and contains unit/integration tests for ``Python``, ``C``, and ``CUDA`` code. The second is via the ``test_installation`` directory which contains a number of commands that can be used to test the functionality of the local installation of ``WODEN``. See below for details.
