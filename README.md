CUDA code designed to compare different visibility generating methods.

Parameters currently extremely hard-coded, soon to be changed into optional inputs. Dumps all data to a binary file output_visi.dat. Needs a new-style RTS srclist. Will add documentation once options are added / if this is going to be published.

I currently use a uvfits template and a python script to convert outputs into uvfits files, and to generate telescope_XYZ.c
